# Website_cleanup


**Background:**
Out of date content on a website, particularly pages, that are no longer being used due to new versions becoming available are called orphaned files. These orphaned files in the form of links have no cross linking present, which means they are not referenced by any of the websites pages. 

**The goal:**
Using python parse through all the html files, representing all the pages of a website. Find all the cross links within each page. Identify the orphaned files to be deleted.
